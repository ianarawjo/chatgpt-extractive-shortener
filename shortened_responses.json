Many of these strategies target endogenous NK cells. Genetic engineering approaches have been also reported for adoptive NK therapy, namely the generation of CAR-NK cells, however, these approaches have limitations from the developmental and safety perspective. Among non-genetic engineering approaches to improve adoptive NK transfer, pre-activation and expansion with cytokines is the most popular strategy. However, the activated NK cells need constant cytokine infusions to maintain their activity in-vivo which may lead to off-target adverse effects.  Co-administration of monoclonal antibodies to induce ADCC is also a widely used approach but relies on tumor-targeting for NK activation. Here, we present an alternate strategy to constantly stimulate NK cells that is scalable, rapid and can synergize with current priming methods in the clinic. MACE represents a modular platform that can be functionalized with surface antibodies or ligands targeting various receptors on the NK cell, thus allowing us to modulate cellular activation status. We designed MACE to target NK receptors of the NCR family and deliver constant activating signals to the cell. We highlight that the mechanism of this signaling is driven by localized microscale receptor clustering, which MACE can induce due to their unique geometry. It was recently reported that the mechanical force on lymphocyte receptors can greatly affect downstream signaling which may also be contribute to the ability of MACE to induce greater signaling as compared to free antibodies.

Adhesion was evaluated by measuring the percentage of cell population binding to at least a single MACE. Antibody-modified MACE were able to adhere to the NK cell surface and were stably integrated with the cell membrane. Interestingly, only few antibodies could effectively mediate adhesion. We selected anti-CD45 as a targeting antibody due to its stable expression on lymphocytes and good adhesion efficiency with 46.6% of cells having at least one attached MACE. MACE without antibody functionalization did not adhere to NK cells whereas anti-CD45 antibody-modified MACE adhered efficiently to all the tested NK cells.
